                    During its time on Mars, InSight (which was co-designed by the University of Oxford) recorded at
                    least 8 marsquake events caused by meteoroid impacts. The largest two of these formed craters around
                    150m in diameter. If the S1222a event was formed by an impact, the crater would be expected to be at
                    least 300m in diameter.

                <p>
                    Degree, also called academic degree, in education, any of several titles conferred by colleges and
                    universities to indicate the completion of a course of study or the extent of academic achievement.
                    The hierarchy of degrees dates back to the universities of 13th-century Europe, which had faculties
                    organized into guilds. Members of the faculties were licensed to teach, and degrees were in effect
                    the professional certifications that they had attained the guild status of a “master.” There was
                    originally only one degree in European higher education, that of master or doctor.

                    master’s, professional, and doctoral degrees. According to information from the US Census Bureau,
                    the number of people with postgraduate degrees has more than doubled since 2000, with more than 21
                    million Americans having a master's degree, and another 4.5 million or more having a doctoral degree

        <p>
            I am loving my degree so far: the range of periods that I study, the ability to tailor my course to my
            interests and the interactions with tutors. I have a high quality social life and plenty of funding for
            travel and academic materials.

                        I would highly recommend Oxford University if you are an academic and self-motivated individual.
                        You will have the chance to meet some interesting people and the tutors will be leaders in their
                        given field. In my experience, they are well aware of the workload and will be understanding if
                        you are struggling.

                        are quite helpful and contain all the information stated in the course overview.
